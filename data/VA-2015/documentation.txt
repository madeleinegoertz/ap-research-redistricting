2015 Election Results by Precinct

Vote Column Label Format
------------------------
Columns reporting votes follow a standard label pattern. One example is:
G16PREDCli
The first character is G for a general election, P for a primary.
Characters 2 and 3 are the year of the election.
Characters 4-6 represent the office type (see list below).
Character 7 represents the party of the candidate.
Characters 8-10 are the first three letters of the candidate's last name.

Office Codes
HOD - House of Delegates, accompanied by a HOD_DIST column indicating district number
SOV - Senate of Virginia, accompanied by a SOV_DIST column indicating district number

Party Codes
D and R will always represent Democrat and Republican, respectively.
See the state-specific notes for the remaining codes used in a particular file; note that third-party candidates may appear on the ballot under different party labels in different states.


Virginia

Election results from Virginia Department of Elections (https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/)

Absentee ballots and provisional votes were reported at the county or city level throughout the state. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct shapefile primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. Virginia election reports often include precinct splits that are obsolete or unused in practice. These have been omitted. In cases where voters were incorrectly assigned to the wrong district the de facto precinct split has been included for that election.

Results are divided across three files. Because precincts can be split across legislative districts, the legislative races are reported with their own geography that divides these split precincts, resulting in shapes that are assigned to exactly one district.
