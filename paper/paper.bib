  abstract = {Legislative redistricting is a critical element of representative democracy. A number of political scientists have used simulation methods to sample redistricting plans under various constraints to assess their impact on partisanship and other aspects of representation. However, while many optimization algorithms have been proposed, surprisingly few simulation methods exist in the published scholarship. Furthermore, the standard algorithm has no theoretical justification, scales poorly, and is unable to incorporate fundamental constraints required by redistricting processes in the real world. To fill this gap, we formulate redistricting as a graph-cut problem and for the first time in the literature propose a new automated redistricting simulator based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. The proposed algorithm can incorporate contiguity and equal population constraints at the same time. We apply simulated and parallel tempering to improve the mixing of the resulting Markov chain. Through a small-scale validation study, we show that the proposed algorithm can approximate a target distribution more accurately than the standard algorithm. We also apply the proposed methodology to data from Pennsylvania to demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to real-world redistricting problems. The open-source software package is available so that researchers and practitioners can implement the proposed methodology. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {We clarify the theoretical foundations of partisan fairness standards for district-based democratic electoral systems, including essential assumptions and definitions that have not been formalized or in some cases even discussed. We pare assumptions down to their minimal essential components and add extensive empirical evidence for those with observable implications. Throughout, we follow a fundamental principle of statistics too often ignored \textemdash{} defining the quantity of interest separately so its measures are vulnerable to being proven wrong, evaluated, and improved. This enables us to prove which approaches \textemdash{} claimed in the literature to be estimators of partisan symmetry, the most widely accepted standard \textemdash{} are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of symmetry at all. Because real world redistricting involves complicated politics with numerous participants and conflicting goals, measures biased for partisan fairness sometimes still provide useful descriptions of other aspects of electoral systems.},

  abstract = {Random sampling of graph partitions under constraints has become a popular tool for evaluating legislative redistricting plans. Analysts detect partisan gerrymandering by comparing a proposed redistricting plan with an ensemble of sampled alternative plans. For successful application, sampling methods must scale to large maps with many districts, incorporate realistic legal constraints, and accurately and efficiently sample from a selected target distribution. Unfortunately, most existing methods struggle in at least one of these three areas. We present a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that draws representative redistricting plans from a realistic target distribution of choice. Because it samples directly, the SMC algorithm can efficiently explore the relevant space of redistricting plans better than the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that yield dependent samples. Our algorithm can simultaneously incorporate several constraints commonly imposed in real-world redistricting problems, including equal population, compactness, and preservation of administrative boundaries. We validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm by using a small map where all redistricting plans can be enumerated. We then apply the SMC algorithm to evaluate the partisan implications of several maps submitted by relevant parties in a recent high-profile redistricting case in the state of Pennsylvania. We find that the proposed algorithm is roughly 40 times more efficient in sampling from the target distribution than a state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.},
