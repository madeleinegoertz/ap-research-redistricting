  abstract = {BARD is the first (and at time of writing, only) open source software package for general redistricting and redistricting analysis. BARD provides methods to create, display, compare, edit, automatically refine, evaluate, and profile political districting plans. BARD aims to provide a framework for scientific analysis of redistricting plans and to facilitate wider public participation in the creation of new plans. BARD facilitates map creation and refinement through command-line, graphical user interface, and automatic methods. Since redistricting is a computationally complex partitioning problem not amenable to an exact optimization solution, BARD implements a variety of selectable metaheuristics that can be used to refine existing or randomlygenerated redistricting plans based on user-determined criteria. Furthermore, BARD supports automated generation of redistricting plans and profiling of plans by assigning different weights to various criteria, such as district compactness or equality of population. This functionality permits exploration of trade-offs among criteria. The intent of a redistricting authority may be explored by examining these trade-offs and inferring which reasonably observable plans were not adopted. Redistricting is a computationally-intensive problem for even modest-sized states. Performance is thus an important consideration in BARD's design and implementation. The program implements performance enhancements such as evaluation caching, explicit memory management, and distributed computing across snow clusters.},

Given that elections in the United States are based around the winner-take-all principle, any redistricting plan will create winners and losers. Therefore, the choice between any set of redistricting algorithms is a choice about who will be winners and who will be losers. Furthermore, because the delegation of responsibility for redistricting is only relevant inasmuch as it affects the choice of redistricting algorithms, the choice of delegation is also a determination of who will win and who will lose. By definition, that choice cannot be apolitical. Moreover, any attempt to evaluate redistricting processes independently of such outcomes devolves the process into a trivial exercise in Nomic.},

Sampling the space of plans amounts to dividing a graph into a partition with a specified number elements which each correspond to a different district. The partitions satisfy a collection of hard constraints and the measure may be weighted with regard to a number of other criteria. When these constraints and criteria are chosen to align well with classical legal redistricting criteria, the algorithm can be used to generate a collection of non-partisan, neutral plans. This collection of plans can serve as a baseline against which a particular plan of interest is compared. If a given plan has different racial or partisan qualities than what is typical of the collection plans, the given plan may have been gerrymandered and is labeled as an outlier.},

This article demonstrates how a straightforward redistricting algorithm can be used to generate a benchmark against which to contrast a plan that has been called into constitutional question, thus laying bare any partisan advantage that cannot be attributed to legitimate legislative objectives. We use the controversial 2012 Florida Congressional map to show how our approach can be used to demonstrate an unconstitutional gerrymander.},

  abstract = {What is the effect of gerrymandering on the partisan outcomes of United States Congressional elections? A major challenge to answering this question is in determining the outcomes that would have resulted in the absence of gerrymandering. Since we only observe Congressional elections where the districts have potentially been gerrymandered, we lack a non-gerrymandered counterfactual that would allow us to isolate its true effect. To overcome this challenge, we conduct computer simulations of the districting process to redraw the boundaries of Congressional districts without partisan intent. By estimating the outcomes of these non-gerrymandered districts, we are able to establish the non-gerrymandered counterfactual against which the actual outcomes can be compared. The analysis reveals that while Republican and Democratic gerrymandering affects the partisan outcomes of Congressional elections in some states, the net effect across the states is modest, creating no more than one new Republican seat in Congress. Therefore, the partisan composition of Congress can mostly be explained by non-partisan districting, suggesting that much of the electoral bias in Congressional elections is caused by factors other than partisan intent in the districting process.},

  abstract = {Partisan favor in the votes-seats relationship is often attributed to gerrymandering, where parties improve their seat share by manipulating district boundaries in order to bias the distribution of votes in their favor. However, recent research by Chen and Rodden (2013), which builds on a thesis developed by Erikson (1972), provides support for the claim that such bias is less a function of gerrymandering than it is a function of the underlying geographic distribution of partisan voters. They find that the tendency for Democrats to cluster in dense urban areas as we see in states like Florida gives Republicans a natural seat advantage in legislatures, even in the presence of redistricting. Still, the link between partisan residential patterns and the votes-to-seats relationship remains undeveloped, in part because we are unable to observe the full spectrum of partisan votes at various levels of partisan clustering. In this paper, however, I attempt to develop this link through simulations. By simulating congressional elections at all levels of partisanship, I can measure the hypothetical electoral outcome that results from adjusting the degree and type of geographic clustering using an agent-based model of segregation. These simulations allow me to observe the potential electoral effect of partisan clustering on the entire vote-seats curve. As a result, I show that residential clustering of partisans tends to flatten the votes-seats curve, making it disadvantageous to the majority party, whichever party that may be. However, when Democrats cluster more than Republicans, the disadvantage is greater for Democratic majorities than for Republican majorities. {${_\ast}$}Postdoctoral Fellow for the Program in Quantitative Social Science, Dartmouth College},

  abstract = {For decades, legislative districts have been drawn with two general mandates, contiguity and compactness. While contiguity is easily discernible, a single accepted measure of district compactness has not been found. Due to the various effects that gerrymandering and noncompact districts have on the aggregation of voter preferences, questions surrounding district compactness have direct implications of representation in democratic theory. Empirical political science has attempted on numerous occasions to formulate a single method by which to measure district compactness. These include various geometric measures such as circularity, convex hulls, and path connectedness, as well as methods that attempt to encompass voter dispersion. The real-world implementation of these compactness measures has been fraught with issues, however. Most apparent among these are natural and state boundaries, which greatly interfere with the implementation of geometric compactness measures. Examples of noncompactness induced by natural boundaries can be seen in the coast of Maine and the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, while noncompactness induced by state boundaries can be seen in West Virginia and Louisiana. Further implementation issues may be found in methods that rely on voter dispersion. This is due to the boundaries that are used to collect apportionment data, namely census tracts, blocks, and precincts. U.S. Census Bureau delineations (tracts, blocks, and precincts) are the spatial granularity by which legislative districts are drawn, and have rigid boundaries. These boundaries not only proscribe the full use of most voter dispersion metrics of compactness, but also lead districts to be naturally conducive to irregular geometry. In this paper, we seek to overcome these geometric issues by using a different discipline of mathematics\textemdash graph theory\textemdash to formulate a new metric of district compactness. This method utilizes graph partitioning with the established goal of balancing the population while minimizing the number of shapes that share an edge with one another. In doing so we formulate a new approach to compactness that is more reflective of the redistricting process, and overcomes traditional issues surrounding natural boundaries, disconnects, and population distribution.},

  abstract = {As cities expand their jurisdictional borders via the process of municipal annexation, they sometimes leave low-income and minority enclaves perpetually excluded on the urban fringe, a process known as municipal underbounding. Despite a number of small-scale studies documenting the gerrymandering of municipal borders, robust empirical evidence of its extent is limited and little is known about the institutional factors that facilitate or stymie efforts to underbound poor and minority communities. In this article, a metropolitan area matching design is used to measure the effect of state annexation laws and federal protection of voting rights under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act on municipal underbounding between 1990 and 2010 in the United States. The analysis finds that laws that facilitate participation by city residents in annexation decisions lead to the underbounding of black neighborhoods, whereas those that provide third-party oversight of annexation decisions or expand opportunities for participation by residents living on the fringe lead to the inclusion of black neighborhoods. There is little evidence that such patterns of underbounding are driven by economic or fiscal considerations. In light of the 2013 invalidation by the Supreme Court of Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, there is likely a nascent return to racial gerrymandering of municipal borders occurring in the South, particularly in states where city residents are granted some measure of influence over annexation. The results suggest the need for renewed attention to local government boundary changes and their role in facilitating and exacerbating racial discrimination.},

  abstract = {Legislative redistricting is a critical element of representative democracy. A number of political scientists have used simulation methods to sample redistricting plans under various constraints to assess their impact on partisanship and other aspects of representation. However, while many optimization algorithms have been proposed, surprisingly few simulation methods exist in the published scholarship. Furthermore, the standard algorithm has no theoretical justification, scales poorly, and is unable to incorporate fundamental constraints required by redistricting processes in the real world. To fill this gap, we formulate redistricting as a graph-cut problem and for the first time in the literature propose a new automated redistricting simulator based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. The proposed algorithm can incorporate contiguity and equal population constraints at the same time. We apply simulated and parallel tempering to improve the mixing of the resulting Markov chain. Through a small-scale validation study, we show that the proposed algorithm can approximate a target distribution more accurately than the standard algorithm. We also apply the proposed methodology to data from Pennsylvania to demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to real-world redistricting problems. The open-source software package is available so that researchers and practitioners can implement the proposed methodology. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

A proposed redistricting plan can be considered gerrymandered if it constitutes an outlier relative to this sample according to partisan fairness metrics. Despite their growing use, an insufficient effort has been made to empirically validate the accuracy of the simulation methods. We apply a recently developed computational method that can efficiently enumerate all possible redistricting plans and yield an independent sample from this population. We show that this algorithm scales to a state with a couple of hundred geographical units. Finally, we empirically examine how existing simulation methods perform on realistic validation datasets.},

  abstract = {The United States Supreme Court has long recognized compactness as an important principle in assessing the constitutionality of political districting plans. We propose a measure of compactness based on the distance between voters within the same district relative to the minimum distance achievable -- which we coin the relative proximity index. We prove that any compactness measure which satisfies three desirable properties (anonymity of voters, efficient clustering, and invariance to scale, population density, and number of districts) ranks districting plans identically to our index. We then calculate the relative proximity index for the 106th Congress, requiring us to solve for each state's maximal compactness; an NP-hard problem. Using two properties of maximally compact districts, we prove they are power diagrams and develop an algorithm based on these insights. The correlation between our index and the commonly-used measures of dispersion and perimeter is -.22 and -.06, respectively. We conclude by estimating seat-vote curves under maximally compact districts for several large states. The fraction of additional seats a party obtains when their average vote increases is significantly greater under maximally compact districting plans, relative to the existing plans.},

  abstract = {Political redistricting is the redrawing of electoral district boundaries. It is normally undertaken to reflect population changes. The process can be abused, in what is called gerrymandering, to favor one party or interest group over another, resulting thereby in broadly undemocratic outcomes that misrepresent the views of the voters. Gerrymandering is especially vexing in the United States. This paper introduces an algorithm, with an implementation, for creating districting plans (whether for political redistricting or for other districting applications). The algorithm, Seed-Fill-Shift-Repair (SFSR), is demonstrated for Congressional redistricting in American states. SFSR is able to create thousands of valid redistricting plans, which may then be used as points of departure for public deliberation regarding how best to redistrict a given polity. The main objectives of this paper are: (i) to present SFSR in a broadly accessible form, including code that implements it and test data, so that it may be used for both civic deliberations by the public and for research purposes. (ii) to make the case for what SFSR essays to do, which is to approach redistricting, and districting generally, from a constraint satisfaction perspective and from the perspective of producing a plurality of feasible solutions that may then serve in subsequent deliberations. To further these goals, we make the code publicly available. The paper presents, for illustration purposes, a corpus of 11,206 valid redistricting plans for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (produced by SFSR), using the 2017 American Community Survey, along with descriptive statistics. Also, the paper presents 1,000 plans for each of the states of Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, using the 2018 American Community Survey, along with descriptive statistics on these plans and the computations involved in their creation.},

Wisconsin's plan acts to preserve the Republican majority by providing extra Republican seats even when the Democratic vote increases into the range when the balance of power would shift for the vast majority of redistricting plans.},

  abstract = {Stochastic hill-climbing algorithms, particularly simulated annealing  SA  and threshold acceptance  TA , have become very popular for global optimization applications. Typical implementations of SA or TA use monotone temperature or threshold schedules, and are not formulated to accommodate practical time limits. We present a new threshold acceptance strategy called Old Bachelor Acceptance  OBA  which has three distinguishing features:  i  it is specifically motivated by the practical requirement of optimization within a prescribed time bound,  ii  the threshold schedule is self-tuning, and  iii  the threshold schedule is non-monotone, with threshold values even allowed to become negative. The standard implementation of the TA method of Dueck and Scheuer is a special case of OBA. Experiments using several classes of symmetric traveling salesman problem instances show that OBA can outperform previous hillclimbing methods for time-critical optimizations. A number of directions for future work are suggested.},

  abstract = {To modern observers of American politics, our current hyperpartisan era appears historically extreme, even bizarrely partisan. The preceding Cold War era was far less partisan and ideologically polarized. Spanning roughly from World War II through the 1980s, it offers a hopeful model for a better, less partisan American politics. However, this historical baseline is badly misleading. Partisanship for most of American history was much more similar to today's hyperpartisanship than the Cold War. And legislative redistricting, for most of American history, was just as intensely partisan as today's hyperpartisan gerrymandering. But it was precisely during the Cold War era of partisan peace that courts inaugurated election law and began overseeing redistricting. The development of redistricting law, and indeed most of election law, therefore occurred during the unusual circumstance of historically low partisanship when partisan complications largely receded from judicial attention. As a result, our inherited law of redistricting developed by courts during the Cold War era is fundamentally mismatched to today's hyperpartisanship and hyperpartisan gerrymandering. Moored to outdated Cold War assumptions, the Supreme Court badly underestimates hyperpartisanship and the effectiveness of hyperpartisan gerrymandering.},

  abstract = {Redistricting is the process of partitioning a set of basic units into a given number of larger groups for electoral purposes. These groups must follow federal and state requirements to enhance fairness and minimize the impact of manipulating boundaries for political gain. In redistricting tasks, one of the most important criteria is equal population. As a matter of fact, redistricting plans can be rejected when the population deviation exceeds predefined limits. In the literature, there are several methods to balance population among districts. However, further discussion is needed to assess the effectiveness of these strategies. In this paper, we considered two different strategies, mean deviation and overall range. Additionally, a compactness measure is included to design well-shaped districts. In order to provide a wide set of redistricting plans that achieve good trade-offs between mean deviation, overall range, and compactness, we propose four multiobjective metaheuristic algorithms based on NSGA-II and SPEA-II. The proposed strategies were applied in California, Texas, and New York. Numerical results show that the proposed multiobjective approach can be a very valuable tool in any real redistricting process.},

  abstract = {Geographic shape compactness is of concern in such contexts as urban morphology, political districting, and accuracy of enumeration unit values. The purpose of the present paper is to compare, categorize, and evaluate the various methods suggested for measuring compactness. Review of suggested compactness indices resulted in the identification of four categories, based upon: 1) perimeter-area measurement, 2) single parameters of related circles, 3) direct comparison to a standard shape, and 4) dispersion of elements of a shape's area. In all, eleven indices were calculated for a sample of U.S. counties and their frequency distributions were compared. Additionally, similarities and differences in the units of high, median, and low compactness were identified. Within each category, indices exhibited considerable similarity while significant differences were evident from category to category. These differences suggested variation in accuracy with which the indices measure compactness. It was hypothesized that measures based upon dispersion of elements of a shape's area would provide the most accurate measure because they consider the shape as a whole while the other indices do not. Determination of the accuracy with which each index measures compactness supported this hypothesis. Indices based upon direct comparison to a standard shape were found to be of similar accuracy and, therefore, also judged to be suitable compactness measures. Those measures based upon perimeter-area measurement and single parameters of related circles were determined to be considerably less accurate measures of compactness.},

  abstract = {Random sampling of graph partitions under constraints has become a popular tool for evaluating legislative redistricting plans. Analysts detect partisan gerrymandering by comparing a proposed redistricting plan with an ensemble of sampled alternative plans. For successful application, sampling methods must scale to large maps with many districts, incorporate realistic legal constraints, and accurately and efficiently sample from a selected target distribution. Unfortunately, most existing methods struggle in at least one of these three areas. We present a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that draws representative redistricting plans from a realistic target distribution of choice. Because it samples directly, the SMC algorithm can efficiently explore the relevant space of redistricting plans better than the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that yield dependent samples. Our algorithm can simultaneously incorporate several constraints commonly imposed in real-world redistricting problems, including equal population, compactness, and preservation of administrative boundaries. We validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm by using a small map where all redistricting plans can be enumerated. We then apply the SMC algorithm to evaluate the partisan implications of several maps submitted by relevant parties in a recent high-profile redistricting case in the state of Pennsylvania. We find that the proposed algorithm is roughly 40 times more efficient in sampling from the target distribution than a state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.},

Equally important, the median-mean comparison serves as an effective indicator of whether gerrymandering is the cause of the inequitable treatment. We apply the standard to six alleged cases of gerrymandering of congressional districts and find three cases are not gerrymanders, three are gerrymanders, and one of the three gerrymanders crosses the threshold to legal significance.},

A classic SMD gerrymander is ``efficient'': it ``cracks'' a party's supporters so they barely lose many seats and ``packs'' the remainder in a few seats that the party wins by large margins. This essay classifies these new metrics and proposes a simple principle for evaluating each metric as a gauge of this efficiency. It finds that only methods that measure the packing and cracking directly through the counting of wasted votes can serve as consistent measures of the concept. Indeed, measures of symmetry in the seats-votes curve not only fail to consistently measure efficiency but suffer from internal contradictions in certain circumstances. Further examination of the wasted votes measures reveals that only a modified version of the ``efficiency gap''\textemdash a measure active in ongoing litigation\textemdash can serve as a measure of efficiency under a wide range of electoral circumstances. Among the rest, there is considerable variation in their ability to serve as appropriate measures of the concept.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This research contributes to the scholarship in technical communication on race by furthering work regarding latinidad and technical documentation. Method: This article looks specifically at the 2017 Texas court case involving the 2011 district map involving districts 23 and 35. The article also analyzes the methods with which legislative mapmakers operate and deploy GIS software. Results: As previous researchers have noted, latinidad is often constructed in political and governmental documents within the United States to position Latinos as a threat to White Americans. Frequently, this constructed threat is mitigated by inflating the contributions of White Americans over their Latino counterparts. Yet, this examination of the 2017 court case illustrates that mapmakers can also utilize Geographic Information Systems to gerrymander districts and thus suppress Latino's voting power to help White Americans maintain political power. Most worrisome is mapmakers' deference to and citation of the Voting Rights Act to justify the creation of districts that account for and control electoral agency. Conclusion: The article concludes by asserting that technical communicators move beyond compliance in order to account for multicultural publics and to avoid engaging in similar technological practices. It also encourages technical communicators to become more active in identifying practices that threaten democratic integrity and in using their skills to promote more socially equitable electoral practices across their teaching, research, and advocacy.},

Much of this work has sought either to introduce new measures of gerrymandering or to analyze a metric--the efficiency gap--that we previously developed. In this Essay, we reframe the debate by presenting a series of criteria that can be used to evaluate gerrymandering metrics: (1) consistency with the efficiency principle; (2) distinctness from other electoral values; (3) breadth of scope; and (4) correspondence with U.S. electoral history. We then apply these criteria to both the efficiency gap and other measures. The efficiency gap complies with our criteria under all circumstances. Other metrics, in contrast, often violate the efficiency principle and cannot be used in certain electoral settings.},

Despite broad disdain for the practice, the Supreme Court has found it difficult to identify a workable standard by which we might regulate political gerrymandering. We have lacked sufficient tools to analyze and synthesize redistricting data, in part, because the requisite computation is massive. At the same time, the recent proliferation of significant computing power has led to the discovery of the extensive and often surprising reach of technology, information, and computation in many realms of life. Our capacities to compile, organize, analyze, and disseminate information have increased dramatically and facilitated the creation of many tools to connect citizens and automate human tasks. We present a computational model that brings these significantly advanced computing capacities to the redistricting process. Our model allows us to understand redistricting in fundamentally new ways and allows us to integrate technological advances with our articulated theories for redistricting and democratic rule while also empowering citizens with new abilities to understand and overturn partisan gerrymanders.},

This paper tests three models describing the inflation of the legislative power of the victorious party and then develops explanations of the observed differences in the swing ratio and the partisan bias of an electoral system. The ``cube law'' is rejected as a description, since it assumes uniformity (which is not observed in the data) across electoral systems. Explanations for differences in swing ratio and bias are found in variations in turnout over districts, the extent of the ``nationalization'' of politics, and, most importantly, in who does the districting or reapportionment. The measures of swing ratio and partisan bias appear useful for the judicial evaluation of redistricting schemes and may contribute to the reduction of partisan and incumbent gerrymandering.},

  abstract = {Recently, scholars from law and political science have introduced metrics which use only election outcomes (and not district geometry) to assess the presence of partisan gerrymandering. The most high-profile example of such a tool is the efficiency gap (EG). Some scholars have suggested that such tools should be sensitive enough to alert us when two election outcomes have the same percentage of votes going to political party A, but one of the two awards party A more seats. When a metric is able to distinguish election outcomes in this way, that metric is said to satisfy the efficiency principle. In this article, we show that the efficiency gap fails to satisfy the efficiency principle. We show precisely how the efficiency principle breaks down in the presence of unequal voter turnout. To do this, we first present a construction that, given any rationals 1/4 {$<$} V\,{$<$}\,3/4 and 0\,{$<$}\,S\,{$<$}\,1, constructs an election outcome with vote share V, seat share S, and EG\,=\,0. (For instance, one party can get 26\% of the vote and anywhere from 1\% to 99\% of the seats while the efficiency gap remains zero.) Then, for any election with vote share 1/4 {$<$} V\,{$<$}\,3/4, seat share S, and EG\,=\,0, we express the ratio {$\rho$} of average turnout in districts party A lost to average turnout in districts party A won as a function in only V and S. It is well known that when all districts have equal turnout, EG can be expressed as a simple formula in V and S; we express the efficiency gap of any election as an equation only in V, S, and {$\rho$}. We also report on the values of {$\rho$} that can be observed in actual elections.},

  abstract = {During the last two decades, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied to a wide range of optimization and decision-making problems. Work on EAs for geographical analysis, however, has been conducted in a problem-specific manner, which prevents an EA designed for one type of problem from being used on others. In this article, a formal, conceptual framework is developed to unify the design and implementation of EAs for many geographical optimization problems. The key element in this framework is a graph representation that defines the spatial structure of a broad range of geographical problems. Based on this representation, four types of geographical optimization problems are discussed and a set of algorithms is developed for problems in each type. These algorithms can be used to support the design and implementation of EAs for geographical optimization. Knowledge specific to geographical optimization problems can also be incorporated into the framework. An example of solving political redistricting problems is used to demonstrate the application of this framework. (English)},

  abstract = {About half of the states currently impose some form of compactness standard on their districting plans. Yet there is no commonly accepted definition of how compactness is to be measured. This paper surveys some of the principal compactness measures gleaned from the literature in political science, geography, law, and mathematics. Although some of these measures are better than others, all are defective in some crucial respect; that is, they fail to give satisfactory results on certain types of geographical configurations. The conclusion is that "compactness" is not a sufficiently precise concept to be used as a legal standard for districting plans.},
